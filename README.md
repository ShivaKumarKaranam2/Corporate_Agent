## Project Overview

Legal document review is often tedious and requires subject matter expertise. This application streamlines the review process for ADGM legal documents by automating:

- Document type detection from uploaded `.docx` files
- Identification of potential legal "red flags" with suggestions
- Validation against a checklist of required documents
- Annotating documents with comments highlighting issues
- Providing an interactive AI-powered Q&A interface to clarify ADGM law queries

---

## Features

- Upload multiple `.docx` files simultaneously for batch processing.
- Extract document text and detect document type using custom logic.
- Detect legal red flags with actionable suggestions.
- Generate downloadable annotated documents and JSON summaries.
- Interactive legal Q&A powered by Google Gemini API.
- Persistent temporary and output directories for auditability.

---

## Implementation Details

- **Document Upload & Parsing**: Using Streamlit's file uploader and `python-docx` to extract text.
- **Document Type Detection**: Rule-based or ML-based detection implemented in `type_detector.py`.
- **Red Flag Detection**: Custom heuristics or pattern matching implemented in `redflags.py`.
- **Checklist Validation**: Ensures submission completeness as per ADGM requirements (`checklist.py`).
- **Document Annotation**: Comments added to `.docx` files via `commenter.py`.
- **Summary Generation**: Produces structured JSON summaries for each document (`summarizer.py`).
- **AI Q&A**: Queries Google Gemini model with user input, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using FAISS vector store (`rag_engine.py`).

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python)
- **Document Processing**: `python-docx`, custom parsers
- **AI Backend**: Google Gemini API (Generative Language Model)
- **RAG Vector Store**: FAISS with HuggingFace Sentence Transformers embeddings
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
